/// A protocol that defines the reactive state and event rules for a model managed by `ManagedState`.
///
/// Conforming types define how a model interacts with the UI and external systems through Combine bindings and notifications.
/// This protocol is typically used in MVVM or unidirectional data flow architectures.
///
/// Use `applyBindingRules(to:)` to bind view updates and side effects to state changes.
/// Use `applyAnyRules(to:)` to handle external events, such as system notifications or app lifecycle changes.
///
/// All types conforming to this protocol must also conform to `Equatable` and `ActionHandling`.

    /// ### Example

    /// typealias RulesPublisher = AnyPublisher<DiffedValue<MyState>, Never>
    /// ```

    /// mutating func applyRules() {
